## 🚂 Railway Deployment

### Step 1: Deploy to Railway
1. Go to [Railway.app](https://railway.app)
2. Click "Deploy from GitHub repo"
3. Connect your repository
4. Railway will automatically detect and use these configs:
   - `railway.json` - Main deployment configuration
   - `nixpacks.toml` - Build settings
   - `Procfile` - Process configuration

### Step 2: Environment Variables
Railway deployment uses these files automatically:
- `server.cjs` - Main server file (CommonJS format)
- No additional environment variables needed for basic functionality

### Step 3: Access Your App
After deployment completes:
- **Main URL**: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app`
- **Admin Panel**: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/admin`
- **Health Check**: `https://your-app-name.up.railway.app/health`

### Railway Configuration Files:
```json
// railway.json
{
  "build": { "builder": "NIXPACKS" },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "node server.cjs",
    "healthcheckPath": "/health"
  }
}
```

## ⚡ Vercel Deployment

### Step 1: Deploy to Vercel
1. Go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "New Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Vercel uses `vercel.json` configuration automatically

### Step 2: Build Configuration
Vercel automatically uses:
- `api/index.ts` - Serverless function
- `vercel.json` - Routing and build config

### Step 3: Access Your App
After deployment:
- **Main URL**: `https://your-project.vercel.app`
- **API Routes**: `https://your-project.vercel.app/api/*`

## 🛠 Troubleshooting

### Railway Issues
1. **404 Errors**: Redeploy using Railway dashboard
2. **Build Failures**: Check `server.cjs` file exists
3. **Port Issues**: Railway automatically assigns PORT environment variable

### Vercel Issues
1. **Function Timeouts**: Check `vercel.json` maxDuration setting
2. **Build Errors**: Verify `api/index.ts` imports correctly
3. **Static Files**: Ensure proper routing configuration

### Common Solutions
- **ES Module Errors**: Use `.cjs` extension for CommonJS files
- **Missing Dependencies**: All required packages in `package.json`
- **Database Connection**: Uses environment variables automatically

## 📞 Support

If deployment fails after following this guide:
