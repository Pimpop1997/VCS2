# Railway Deployment - Final Setup

## Current Status
✅ Server tested and working locally  
✅ CommonJS compatibility resolved (.cjs extension)  
✅ Health check endpoint functional  
✅ Admin panel ready  

## What to Do Next

### 1. Railway Dashboard Actions
1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
2. Navigate to the **Deployments** tab
3. Click **"Redeploy"** on the latest deployment
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for completion

### 2. Expected Results
After successful deployment:
- URL: https://rmt-production.up.railway.app/
- Working admin panel with login form
- Functional API endpoints
- System statistics display

### 3. Test These URLs
- `https://rmt-production.up.railway.app/` - Main admin panel
- `https://rmt-production.up.railway.app/health` - Health check
- `https://rmt-production.up.railway.app/api/admin/dashboard-stats` - API test

### 4. Files That Fixed the Issue
- `simple-server.cjs` - Standalone server using CommonJS
- `railway.json` - Updated start command
- `nixpacks.toml` - Build configuration

### 5. If Still Getting 404
Check Railway deployment logs for:
```
BergDotBet Admin Panel Started
Server running on: http://0.0.0.0:[PORT]
```

### 6. Connect Full Database System
To enable complete functionality:
1. Add `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in Railway
2. Change start command to: `NODE_ENV=production tsx server/index.ts`
3. All user management, transactions, and features will be available

The simplified server provides a working foundation that can be upgraded to the full system.
