# Critical Railway Deployment Fix

## Problem Analysis
Railway 404 error persists despite working server code. This indicates Railway deployment configuration issues.

## Root Cause
Railway may not be detecting the correct start command or port binding.

## Solution Implemented
1. **Multiple Start Options**: Created Procfile, railway.json, and nixpacks.toml
2. **Simplified Server**: Using pure Node.js HTTP server (start.cjs)
3. **Port Detection**: Automatic PORT environment variable detection
4. **Health Check**: Dedicated /health endpoint

## Final Configuration Files

### start.cjs (Main Server)
- Pure Node.js HTTP server
- No external dependencies
- Automatic port binding to Railway's PORT variable
- Built-in health check and admin panel

### railway.json
- Start command: node start.cjs
- Health check: /health
- Proper timeout and retry settings

### nixpacks.toml
- Simple build process
- Node.js 18 environment
- Production environment variables

### Procfile
- Heroku-style process definition
- Web process specification

## Railway Dashboard Steps
1. Navigate to your Railway project
2. Go to Deployments tab
3. Click "Redeploy" on latest deployment
4. Monitor build logs for success
5. Test URL: https://rmt-production.up.railway.app/

## Expected Deploy Logs
Look for these messages in Railway deployment logs:
```
BergDotBet Admin Panel running on port [PORT]
Railway URL: https://rmt-production.up.railway.app
```

## Backup Solution
If Railway continues to fail, the issue may be:
1. Repository connection problems
2. Railway service limitations
3. Account-specific deployment restrictions

Alternative: Deploy to Vercel instead using the provided vercel.json configuration.
