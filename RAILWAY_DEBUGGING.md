# Railway Deployment Debugging Guide

## Current Status: 404 Error Persists
Railway is returning 404 errors for all endpoints, indicating the application isn't starting properly.

## Possible Causes
1. **Railway Service Issues**: Platform may be experiencing problems
2. **Port Binding**: Application not binding to Railway's assigned PORT
3. **Build Failure**: Application failing to build or start
4. **Configuration**: Incorrect Railway project settings

## Immediate Actions Required

### Check Railway Dashboard
1. Go to Railway project dashboard
2. Navigate to "Deployments" tab
3. Check latest deployment status:
   - Green = Success
   - Red = Failed
   - Yellow = Building

### View Deployment Logs
1. Click on the latest deployment
2. Check "Build Logs" section for errors
3. Check "Deploy Logs" for runtime errors
4. Look for these key messages:
   - "Server running on port [PORT]"
   - Any error messages
   - "Build completed successfully"

### Verify Environment Variables
1. Go to "Variables" tab in Railway
2. Confirm these variables exist:
   - `PORT` (should be auto-set by Railway)
   - `NODE_ENV` (should be "production")

## Expected Log Messages
Successful deployment should show:
```
Server running on port [PORT]
```

## Alternative Deployment Strategy
If Railway continues to fail, consider:
1. **Vercel Deployment**: Use existing vercel.json configuration
2. **Different Railway Project**: Create new Railway service
3. **Manual Debug**: Check Railway community forums for known issues

## Next Steps Based on Logs
- **If build fails**: Check package.json and dependencies
- **If deploy fails**: Check port binding and startup command
- **If no logs**: Railway service may have issues
